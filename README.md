This is a personal project I started out of curiosity. Firstly, I've always wanted to learn how to code but the learning curve is too steep and too expensive, at least in my world.
Secondly, I discovered Google AI Studio and started experimenting. With this app I want to see if I can solve a real world problem, my wife has been fasting for a couple of months now
but she doesn't have a coach or companion to help her trhough her journey. And since I'm not participating, I figured I could build an app for her and she was over the moon with how it 
turned out. Hopefully, the outside world will be just as ensthused as my wife. Here goes nothing!
